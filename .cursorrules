# PartnerCenter — Cursor Rules

## Global (User Rules)

- Always work in small, logical commits.
- Before coding, update docs/contracts if behavior changes.
- Prefer simplicity over abstraction; avoid microservices and “architecture astronaut”.
- Never invent business rules. If unsure: trace current code/data and document as “unknown” + validation plan.

## Project Rules

- `/docs` is the source of truth for system understanding.
- No “quick fixes” touching CSV import/dedupe without a test covering the case.
- Mobile-first: any UI must be validated on a small viewport (no horizontal overflow).
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` updated for any behavior change.
